* Description
This repository contains my personal emacs dotfiles powered by [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]]. Most interesting things happen in =config.org= which gets tangled automatically by Doom.

- config.org - contains all of my public personal config
- init.el - contains all configurations managed by Doom
- packages.el - emacs package declarations managed by =straight.el=
